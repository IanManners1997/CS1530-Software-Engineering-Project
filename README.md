## Pittition
> Mobile App submitted to University of Pittsburgh Mobile app Challenge
#### Note: This following repository does not include the components directory


### Overview
<p>With almost 20,000 students, problems that students take up with certain aspects about the University are frequent. With such a large University, it can be hard to get your voice heard by University administrators and other students. 
Our app aims to bridge the gap in communication between students and administration by providing a forum for students to collectively voice their concerns. Students can create new pittitions, or sign, comment, and share existing ones. Members of the administration would have the ability to close, accept, and reject pittitions based on how many signatures it accrued, or how feasible the problem is to solve.
</p>

### Tech Stack
<p>Pittition was built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React native, Node.js) and Redux</p>

### Platform Support
<p>The app works both on iOS and Android</p>
